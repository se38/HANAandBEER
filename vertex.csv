They blended dark and pale roasted malted barley with select hops and allowed for longer aging to create a robust beer with an exceptionally creamy head.

Unfortunately\, most of these structures have fallen victim to the farmer's plow over the past 150 years.  Not far from the brewery\, lying preserved on the floor of Rock Lake\, are two effigy mounds - a Headless Man and a Turtle.  Legend tells us\, as the Turtle can survive on both land and in water\, its spirit helped guide the Headless Man into the afterlife.  May the Turtle's spirit guide you to happiness with a Headless Man Amber Alt. The Headless Man is brewed in the \\old way\\\" of a DÃ¼sseldorf-style Altbier.

So...here we are 3 weeks later\, the beer is on tap and it is the freshest...hoppiest...flavorful beer you can imagine! Needless to say\, we are proud of this beauty from the ground\, up! We wanted a full-flavored IPA\, so Bryan suggested we use our Requiem IPA recipe\, and calculate for fresh\, whole hop cones. Worked beautifully!! We ended up with an IPA with so much up-front flavor you would think you are enjoying a high octane Imperial! Instead\, this is a middle-of-the-road IPA\, at 5.2% abv!! This just goes to show how a hugely flavorful IPA can be loaded-up with fresh ingredients and come out the other end\, a tasty LOW octane\, treat! Bryan and I hope you get to stop in soon to try this one out! We decorated Bube's with some of the actual hop vines we pulled from. For the true hophead\, you will be in heaven. And for the all-around beer enthusiasts\, we hope you can appreciate the creativity in this beer. I know I'm proud to say I had a hand in this one!!","5.20"

Scratch #15â€™s espresso blend is a medium city-type roast featuring beans from three continents. St. Thomas Roasters roasted and ground the beans; we used them in our hopback. At the end of the boil the hot wort passed through the espresso beans to give a lush coffee espresso nose and hints of coffee flavor. Chocolate\, roasted and caramel malt flavors stand out\, while the addition of oats gives Scratch #15 a full\, round mouth feel. Galena and Ken Goldings hops are added to balance the overall flavor and not drive up the bitterness.The head retention diminishes quickly because of the oils from the espresso beans.","6.00"

Chico Estate Harvest Ale is one of the very few estate harvest ales produced anywhere in the world today. All the hops in the beer are grown naturally on the premises of our brewery in Chico. We pick the hops ourselves and then take them directly to the brew kettle\, without being dried\, just after picking so they retain nearly all of their natural oils and resins. It is made with Cascade\, Centennial and Chinook hops. Until now\, this beer has only been available in draft.

But there's another reason we brewed this beer\, one that's closer to our home and hearts. Hopheads.  Ten years ago we brewed our first batch of Shoals Pale Ale\, our American interpretation of the traditional British ESB (Extra Special Bitter) style. At the time\, it was widely considered to be darned hoppy. However\, a funny thing happened over the last decade - our Shoals Pale Ale didn't change; beer lovers did\, and we started to hear more and more: â€œWhy don't you guys make a really hoppy beer?â€ You could say\, then\, that Smuttynose IPA is a physical salute to the glory of the American hop grower. The citrusy hop flavor coming from a mixture of Simcoe and Santiams is pleasantly balanced by a smooth bitterness from the Amarillo hops. The beer itself is light bodied and crisp with a golden color that will throw a slight haze\, as we bottle it unfiltered. At 65 IBU's\, this is definitely not a training-wheels IPA\, but is meant for hop lovers looking to satisfy their craving in a way that's not easy to find. We think theyâ€™ll be quite pleased.","5.60"

Consider Scratch #19; originally designed as an enhanced take on Scratch #15 with a slightly higher ABV\, our brewers went to town to deliver a brew slightly more akin to our fabled Scratch #5\, the Imperial Oatmeal Stout brewed for The Flying Mouflan Experience. For Scratch #19\, we teamed up with St. Thomas Roasters of Linglestown to create a special blend of espresso beans. They added Kenyan beans to the mix because of a strong citrus flavor that compliments the hops. Creating en environment akin a French press\, the beans are combined with whole flower hops in the hopback\, and the hot wort passes through the vessel on the way to fermentation giving Scratch #19 a lush coffee espresso nose and hints of coffee flavor. There is a silky quality to the mouthfeel and a citrus hop finsh coming from the Kenyan beans and hops. Some stories have twists\, and unfortunately a faulty valve in the fermentation cellar led to a dramatic beer tragedy one afternoon in the brewery. Risking life and limb (while keeping his mouth open to sample the beer)\, a heroic brewery team member took the dive reconnecting the valve and saving about half the batch of Scratch #19. So for your amusement (and our final relief)\, we give you a draft-only release of a third-take on a style that demands continued research for the Troegs Brewery staff. Enjoy!","9.50"

The natural flavours of the beans selected and hand roasted by our friends at the Union Coffee Roasters go well with the roast barley in the beer to give a silky-smooth drink with distinct chocolate and vanilla notes.  Our first formulation of this beer was the first UK brewed beer to carry the Fairtrade logo\, and\, although we have reformulated it to create an even better blend of malt and roast coffee flavours\, we can no longer get enough coffee in each bottle to qualify for Fairtrade status. However we are still using the same Faitrade Araba Bourbon beans from Rwandaâ€™s Abuhuzamugambi Bakawa Co-operative. At the Meantime Brewing Co we love flavour\, so it wasnâ€™t exactly difficult for us to see how the scents and aromas of coffee and barley would create a perfect match like just like mint and lamb\, toffee and banana\, peaches and cream\, peanut butter and jam. Serve lightly chilled with as many chocolate truffles as your conscience allows. Each serving is equal to one cup of coffee","6.00"

For the next several batches individual Troegs brewers will create recipes of their choice. First up\, The Ticeman had a hankering for a sweet stout\, so the Troegs brothers and all the brewers met with Scharffen Berger Chocolate Company engineers to eat ridiculous amounts of cocoa nibs and chocolates over a few pints of beer. This collaboration resulted in the delivery of a special blend of cocoa nibs that were added during the boiling process. In addition to the nibs\, lactose was added at the end of the boil to give a little sweetness in the body. The addition of Galena and Simcoe hops lends a subtle fruity balance. After primary fermentation\, the beer was aged for three weeks on a blend of cocoa nibs and Ugandan vanilla beans.

Wet hop beers are brewed using fresh\, â€œwetâ€ hops instead of traditional dried hopsâ€”hops contain about 60% moisture when they are first picked. Typically\, when hops are picked they are quickly dried and refrigerated to increase shelf life and make them more consistent for brewing. Freshly picked wet hops\, however\, need to be used within hours of harvest or they will begin to degrade rapidly. Wet hops retain more of their natural aroma and volatile flavors that dissipate when dried. This gives wet hop beers a fresher hop flavor and aroma than that of beers hopped with processed hops. This yields an immersed\, intense hop flavor in the beer. Harpoon brewer Ray Dobens\, creator of the beer\, added a heroic dose of fresh hops the day of the harvest.The hop flavor and aroma from this copper-colored ale comes from a generous late addition of freshly harvested â€œwetâ€ hops.","6.70"

Although no longer home to forests of giant cedars and salt hay marshes teeming with aquatic life\, the Meadowlands is still an amazingly diverse ecosystem providing vital animal and plant habitat. In a nod to a once common food plant here\, weâ€™ve brewed this beer with wild rice. We also used brown and white rice\, as well as two malts. Rice helps the beer ferment dry to better showcase the five different hops weâ€™ve added. Lots and lots of them.

In 1997\, a Fort Collins flood destroyed the original recipe our researcher\, Phil Benstein\, found in the library. So Phil and brewmaster\, Peter Bouckaert\, traveled to Belgium to retrieve this unique style lost to the ages. Their first challenge was deciphering antiquated script and outdated units of measurement\, but trial and error (and many months of in-house sampling) culminated in 1554\, a highly quaffable dark beer with a moderate body and mouthfeel.","5.50"

It is derived from bitter ales but contains even more alcohol and hops. This helped preserve the beer on its long sea journey around Cape Hope to India. British troops returning from India brought their love of this beer back with them so breweries began brewing it for the home market as well. Sadly\, the style had mostly died out in England by the late twentieth century. American home brewers began to brew I.P.A. because of their love for the intense hoppiness of the style. In time American I.P.A.s became much more aggressively bitter and hoppy than their historical predecessors. Big Eye I.P.A. is our version of this wonderful style.  American Centennial hops are  used exclusively to bitter\, flavor\, finish\, and dry hop the Big Eye. Its full hop flavor is guaranteed to please the palate of the true hop head.","6.00"

Its light amber color and slightly spicy malt character are derived from the use of German Dark Munich Malt and Rye Malt respectively. North American 2-row barley combines with the other grains to lay the foundation for the hop onslaught to come. Summit hops are used exclusively in the boil for bitterness\, flavor and aroma but it doesnâ€™t end there. Post-fermentation dry hopping allows the 9.5% ABV monstrosity to gently coax the citrus rind and grapefruit aroma to join the 100 IBUs already present. This beer should greet you with a pungent citrus blast\, provide a spicy yet round middle and finish with a brisk\, clean bitterness.","10.00"

The exclusive use of two row barley not only imparts a full\, smooth body but also gives the beer a wide spectrum of malt flavor ranging from slightly sweet to caramel to slightly roasted. The Noble hops varieties\, Hallertau Mittelfruh and Tettnang Tettnanger\, add a wide range of floral\, piney and citrus notes\, which are present from the aroma\, through the flavor\, to the lingering smooth finish. We take great pride in the Noble hops used in our beers. They are hand selected by Jim Koch and our other brewers from the world's oldest hops growing area.

5477,3920,"BEER","Merry Monks","","","","","","Merry Monks' Ale is a Belgian style Abby Trippel without limitation.  This style was created by Trappist Monks in Belgium over 500 years ago. To be true to the style\, Merry Monks' Ale is bottle conditioned. This means we add a bit of sugar and yeast just prior to bottling. This imparts a special effervescence to the beer\, a creamier carbonation\, and also extends the shelf life. The on-going fermentation inside the bottle will change the character of the beer as it ages\, and you'll find it becomes dryer with age. You may want to lay down a few bottles for future evaluation. We suggest storing at cellar temperatures -around 55 degrees F- and away from light. When you try this beer you're in for a unique treat. The special effervescence and creaminess are immediately apparent when pouring. The Pilsner malts combined with the Belgian yeast strains  yield a remarkable and complex flavor- perhaps you'll note subtle hints of fruit or spice. The flavor is nicely balanced and the finish moderate to dry \, begging for the next sip. You might ask why we go through all this trouble and expense for just a beer\, but one taste and you'll know the Merry Monks' Ale (9.3% ABV) will more than complement any meal it accompanies. Enjoyed best around 48 degrees F\, it also makes a fine after-dinner drink.","9.30"

The taste predominates with a warm\, roasty flavor\, balanced out with a slightly dry finish. It's smooth but not cloying\, with a warming belt of alcohol (5.6% ABV). Although winter ales predate history\, they are believed to have their origin in the pagan celebrations of winter solstice. Later\, when monasteries produced the local brew\, winter ales were made each year to commemorate the birth of Christ. Back then\, winter ales were brewed full-bodied as a source of nutrition for the upcoming winter months. Today\, winter ales are typified by their seasonality\, their rich\, malty flavors and by their deep\, dark coloration. Generally available November-March\, Weyerbacher Winter Ale is the perfect libation for a winter meal\, with good friends\, or beside a warm fire fending off a cold winter night.","5.60"

Introduced by Weyerbacher in 2005 originally as a seasonal\, this brew has garnered numbers so high on Beer Advocate\, and been in such high demand by consumers\,  we decided to add it to our year-round line-up in March 2007. Check it out\, and you'll soon see why everyone's talking about it.","9.00"
5487,3930,"BEER","Eleven","","","","","","Our Eleventh anniversy ale\, released in July 2006 only is a Triple IPA made exclusively with Phoenix hops. 11.7% abv make this Triple IPA powerful\, but the Phoenix hops keep it smooth.  Phoenix is another one of those hops with low cohumulone levels\, which means  when used in very large quantities (as we do in Eleven) the hops flavor is very smooth\, not a hint of harshness for the enormous amounts of hops in the brew.  As with all of our Anniversay ales\, this one will age fantastically and will never be made again\, as each anniversary is an entirely different brew.","11.70"
5488,3931,"BEER","Heresy","","","","","","This incredibly intriguing Imperial Stout is made by aging our Old Heathen in some very famous Oak barrels that were used for aging bourbon! What do we have when we are done? A stout whose very essence has been enhanced. A stout whose complexity has been increased. A stout with notes of Oak\, whiskey and vanilla melding together to create a new sensation. Have we gone too far this time? We don't think so. Heresy is a step above and a leap beyond the extraordinary. Taste it and see what everyone is talking about. 8.0% ABV","8.00"
5489,3932,"BEER","Hops Infusion","","","","","","Hops Infusion is loaded with piney\, citrusy notes\, much hops complexity\, and a strong foundation of malt underneath it all.. Glowing a deep amber color\, Hops Infusion is brewed with seven types of hops. Simcoe\, Magnum\, Cascade\, Liberty\, Saaz\, Fuggles and E. Kent Goldings give this beer the complexity that's so interesting. Our brewers intention on Hops Infusion was to create a complexity of hops flavor and aromas\, not found in any other beer. Originally developed for our BrewPub (no longer open)\, Hops Infusion was ahead of its time in 1998\, but eventually became over shadowed by plethora of entries from other brewers in the India Pale Ale category\, with everyone pushing the envelope on hops content more and more. So\, in late 2005 we redesigned this beer with an entirely new recipe and new packaging as well. The results are unmistakable\, Hops Infusion is clearly a leading IPA once again. We brew Hops Infusion (6.2% ABV\, 1.068 OG) all year 'round. So if your local beer store doesn't have it\, tell 'em to get moving!","6.20"
5490,3933,"BEER","House Ale","","","","","","House Ale\, our 4.5% session ale\, was first brewed in 2006.  Our goal was to brew a beer that was a little bit lower in alcohol\, but did not lack for body and flavor. We're sure you'll agree\, that's just what we achieved with this tasty brew.  Brewed with Pale\, Caramunich\, and Carapils malt for flavor and body\, then hopped exclusively with expensive Tettnang hops\, a very delicate\, delicious hops that perfectly fits this beer with just the right snap of flavor.   Available only in Pennsylvania\, in our Variety Pack Case.","4.50"

This incredible combination creates a melange of flavors such as malt\, dates\, oak\, vanilla\, and bourbon just to name a few. Insanity is 11.1% ABV.

5494,3937,"BEER","Old Heathen","","","","","","Rich\, velvety and deliciously complex\, Old Heathen is a truly distinctive winter warmer. We use seven types of malt and two varieties of hops to bring forth this big brew. Quite robust and roasty on the palate\, Old Heathen imperial stout has a wonderfully fruity nose and a moderately dry finish. The taste is highly complex- perhaps you'll even discern notes of espresso or chocolate.  Old Heathen imperial stout is our interpretation of a beer style that originated in the 18th century. Brewed in England and exported to Germany\, Scandinavia and Russia\, these beers became fashionable among the members of the Czar's court. In order to survive long voyages they were brewed with high alcohol content to prevent spoilage. And at 8.0% ABV (alcohol by volume) Old Heathen definitely contains a warming belt. You may want to lay down a few bottles for future evaluation- this beer keeps well and will only get better with age. Like most of our beers\, Weyerbacher Old Heathen is a perfect accompaniment to foods. Try it with rich stews\, oysters\, caviar or roasted meats. Old Heathen is also a perfect companion to chocolate desserts. Old Heathen is now available year-round.","8.00"

5496,3939,"BEER","Quad","","","","","","Grand Champion in the 2000\, and again in 2004 at United States Beer Tasting Championship\, Weyerbacher QUAD is the first quadrupel style beer to be commercially brewed and bottled in the United States. In December 2002 QUAD won Mid-Atlantic Champion at the USBTC for the third year in a row. Massively big and delicious\, QUAD is an elegant and dark ale. Rich with complexity and flavor\, try savoring it after a long day or during a fine dinner. You also might enjoy it as an aperitif or as an accompaniment to a dessert\, but QUAD stands alone quite well. We recommend enjoying QUAD in a brandy snifter or wineglass so you can drink in the aroma of this fine elixir. QUAD\, with an alcohol content of 11.8% (by volume) is the strongest beer we make\, so please pay proper accord as you enjoy it. As with any higher alcohol beers\, QUAD will be at its best after a period of 6 or 12 months in the bottle\, perhaps longer. We expect a shelf life of 3-5 years\, but go ahead\, we know you can't wait (we couldn't either). Enjoy one now\, and another every month or two\, and you'll be truly amazed as QUAD gains smoothness and complexity over time as it ages.","11.80"

5498,3941,"BEER","Twelve","","","","","","Our 12th anniversary brew is a Rye Barleywine.  Checking in at 10.2% abv\, Twelve is being released in July and through the end of the year.   Made from 50% Rye Malt and 50% Barley Malt\, this strong ale is extremely viscous. The rye adds a tantalizing note of flavor on the palate with a hint of tartness you've come to expect from Rye.  Slightly warm when its young\, the beer will age very well\, perhap 5 years or more.  We're guessing that peak taste will be in the 1 to 2 year old range\, with 3 and 4 not far behind.  Be sure to lay some down in your collection.","10.20"
5499,3942,"BEER","Samuel Adams OctoberFest","","","","","","The first thing you notice when pouring a glass of this seasonal beer is the color.

Our water originates in the 1\,500 square-mile Juneau Ice Field and from the more than 90 inches of rainfall Juneau receives each year.","5.30"

The cool tunnels of the mine shaft provide natural refrigeration and a prime environment for the aging process.  Like a fine wine\, Alaskan Barley Wine can be aged for years. The bottling of the 2007 vintage of Alaskan Barley Wine will allow individuals to age it to their liking. â€œWe figured weâ€™d leave it up to individuals as to how long to age their Alaskan Barley Wine\,â€ said Quality Assurance Analyst Ryan Harvey. â€œSome people like barley wines fresh\, and others store it for years.â€","10.40"

Though the recipe and process for Arctic Devil have evolved over the years\, it is typically brewed in January then aged in oak barrels for several months before the entire batch is blended\, bottled and released on the Friday after Thanksgiving.  In its youth\, Arctic Devil gnarls and snarls its way across the palate. Containing this beast of a beer for long periods in oak barrels--some having previously aged port\, wine or whiskey--tames the unleashed malt and fierce hop flavors\, melding and mellowing this powerful liquid into an incredible elixir worthy of a brewer's table.  Each annual batch of Arctic Devil Barley Wine represents the brewers' resolve to create an intriguing and sought-after barley wine by precisely brewing to well-designed specifications\, carefully selecting the type and combination of barrels to use for aging\, and meticulously checking the beer as it ages. Distinct nuance and complexity are contributed by the wood's previous tenants\, resulting in unique flavor profiles in each batch that continue to change over time. We invite you to savor Arctic Devil Barley Wine upon its release then cellar some for future enjoyment.  Midnight Sun's elusive Arctic Devil Barley Wine is Alaska's most awarded barley wine.","13.20"

Negra Modelo pours with an off-white\, medium head. The body is clear with a rich amber/copper color. The aroma is sweet with hints of apple. The impression at the first sip is sweet. This gives way only a bit to some hops bitterness which gives some balance but leaves the beer firmly in the sweet category. It has no real lager snap at the end\, just lingering hops. This actually makes the second sip more balanced than the first. There is some complexity and depth here but the flavors are very delicate. They are obliterated by the aggressive flavors of the Mexican food that Modelo is often served with making it a sweet balance to the savory and sometimes hot cuisine.","6.00"

6193,4674,"BEER","Blast Furnace Oatmeal Stout","","","","","","Stouts have typically been a staple beverage in the UK.  There are many variations of stouts available. You can find dry stouts\, milk stouts\, Imperial stouts\, American stouts\, and even stouts made with oats. At the Church Brew Works we have crafted delicious Toasted Oatmeal Stout.  The oats were blended with the best barley malt we have â€“ and we didnâ€™t stop there.  To give this beer a wonderful roasted flavor\, we added unmalted\, very darkly roasted barley.  The roasted barley is mixed with a generous portion of chocolate colored malt giving the Blast Furnace Stout a beautiful ruby hue. We used our finest hops unsparingly to create a delicately balanced bitterness with a rich roastiness and fresh hop aroma. The Fuggles and East Kent Goldings hops were added with heavy hands at two different times.  This unbridled addition grants a full hop flavor to our heavenly drink. A typical oatmeal stout is a bit lower in alcohol than most other stouts as does the Blast Furnace Stout.  Ours\, though not typical\, does have a welcome medium body.  As you drink this beer\, notice the rich\, creamy brown head.  Drink it slowly and savor the flavors.  We donâ€™t think you will be disappointed.  Beer is not just for breakfast anymore.","4.80"

For those who are interested\, Â°Plato is a measurement of the sugar content before fermentation.  It is a very malty lager beer with medium hop bitterness.  A maibock is a light to amber colored bock beer.  A Maibock is very similar to a Helles/pale bock.  Maibocks were originally brewed for the coming of spring\, hence the name Mai (German for May).  The Mad Brewer Maibock is medium amber in color.  Though similar in color to our Pipe Organ Pale Ale\, it is very different in character.  Donâ€™t let it get you though\, itâ€™s a very strong beer at about 7% alcohol. It has a very clean and malty nose.  The hop bitterness is evident\, but not dominant.  The Mad Brewer Maibock will finish quite full and have a delicate sweetness.","7.00"

Well Iâ€™ve got the answer.  How about a light thirst quenching Hefe Weizen (pronounced hefa Vite zen) in the cool environment of our Hop Garden patio.  I can hear you wondering\, what is a hefe weizen?  Allay your fears my friends because Iâ€™m going to tell you.  A hefe weizen is a special style of beer made with malted wheat and malted barley.  Hefe weizens are from Germany.  This beer is top fermented (an ale) with a very special yeast.  The Hop levels are kept deliberately low in order to bring out the character of the yeast.  If you notice the nose of the beer\, it has a clove-like or fruity aroma.  The grain bill includes 50% wheat malt and 50% barley malt.  It is served very carbonated and a touch cloudy.  It is cloudy because it is served unfiltered.  The remaining yeast contributes flavor\, adds B vitamins\, and improves the beer as it ages.","4.50"

The morning of the scheduled hop delivery in Denver\, Great Divideâ€™s brewers begin brewing Fresh Hop and are ready to hop the beer just as the fresh hops are delivered. Using fresh hops is a big endeavor\, requiring four to five times the volume of hops compared to the usual process of using pelletized hops. This complex process brings impressive results: Fresh Hop is an American-Style Pale Ale with moderate hop bitterness marked by a unique and intensely grassy hop flavor and aroma. Fresh Hop is a superbly refreshing\, medium bodied\, light-copper colored pale ale.","6.10"

6434,4960,"BEER","Bengali Tiger","","","","","","Sixpoint Bengali Tiger is reminiscent of the century-old English IPA. In my perspective\, many current IPAs suffer from lacking substance; unbalanced by a hoppy assertiveness that is not substantiated by a strong foundation of rich malt flavors. Our interpretation uses the highest-quality\, floor-malted base malt\, which lends a full-bodied and rich caramel flavor. We mash at high temperatures and add generous amounts of specialty malts to further emphasize a strong foundation of malt as leverage for our generous additions of hopsâ€¦ Which are indeed generous. We use a total of three different hop strains\, and add a total of six different additions throughout the process. The Bengali Tiger has a hoppy snap upfront\, but strides at a steady pace\, and finishes balanced. The signature characteristic of the Tiger is the aromaâ€¦ we use massive quantities of whole East Kent Goldings hops to dry hop in our conditioning tanks. The result? The essential oils from the hops are an enticing treat before every sip. Notice the lacing of stripes around the pint glass as you finish your glass; itâ€™s the mark of the Tiger.","6.50"

6437,4963,"BEER","Wild Raspberry Ale","","","","","","What better way to surprise a beer lover than with a fruit beer that tastes like beer? Nine years ago\, we began our quest to provide beer lovers with a worthy fruit beer\, by rolling out Wild Raspberry Ale. Our mantra is that real fruit makes real beer\, so we ferment Wild Raspberry Ale with hundreds of pounds of real red and black raspberries. We steadfastly refuse to fall prey to extracts and cheap syrups. Sure\, squirting syrup into a keg of beer and rolling it around on the floor is easy\, but the taste is...  fake! Over the past nine years\, we have stayed true to our commitment to real fruit\, no matter what the time\, expense\, or late season frosts have thrown our way. One year\, Mother Nature delivered a late cold snap that was so severe\, we had to pre-order 85% of the harvestable U.S. black raspberry crop\, just to meet the demand for Wild Raspberry Ale. Our efforts do not go unrewarded â€“ Wild Raspberry Ale is a truly effervescent\, ruby red ale that achieves the almost impossible balance between malted barley and tart raspberry fruitiness. Its naturally tart character makes Wild Raspberry the ultimate accompaniment to spicy Mexican food or on its own as a stand-alone session beer.","5.60"
